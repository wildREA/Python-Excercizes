<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

The project was made by a Data- & Communication student as part of his week of Python language learning. Although it was unecessary, seeing as it is done without a chunk of code as well as having used certain unmentioned syntax. Additionally there has been made extra features and debugging in order to have not just to have no errors in the code, but also having no warnings entirely (goes for project files only).
